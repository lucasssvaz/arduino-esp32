/**
 * @file
 * @brief Unified GATT registration coordinator (NimBLE).
 *
 * NimBLE cannot support two independent GATT owners: two `ble_gatts_start()`
 * calls wipe each other (`ble_att_svr_start` reallocates the attribute pool),
 * and `ble_svc_gap_init` / `ble_svc_gatt_init` are non-idempotent. So there
 * must be exactly ONE commit for the whole attribute table, into which every
 * contributor (the classic `BLEServer` and the LE Audio engine) stages its
 * services first.
 *
 * This coordinator owns that single lifecycle. It has two modes:
 *
 *  - **Standalone** (no audio): the coordinator itself performs the classic
 *    `reset -> svc_gap_init -> svc_gatt_init -> add_svcs -> ble_gatts_start`
 *    sequence, exactly as the previous `BLEServer::start()` did. Behaviour for
 *    non-audio sketches is unchanged.
 *
 *  - **Audio** (engine present): the LE Audio engine does `svc_gap_init` /
 *    `svc_gatt_init` (in `esp_ble_audio_common_init`) and the single
 *    `ble_gatts_start` (in `esp_ble_audio_common_start`). Here the coordinator
 *    must NOT reset or start; `BLEServer::start()` only *stages* its services
 *    (`ble_gatts_add_svcs`) and the engine's `common_start` commits everything
 *    at once via `BLEAudio::start()`.
 *
 * The coordinator does not carry a separate "audio mode" flag: `audioModeActive()`
 * is derived from the LE Audio engine's own lifecycle (`BLEAudioEngine::isInitialized()`),
 * so audio mode is exactly the window between `audio.begin()` and `audio.end()`.
 * This keeps the mode single-sourced in the engine and leaves the engine itself
 * free of any GATT-coordinator (i.e. NimBLE-only) knowledge.
 *
 * Required ordering in audio mode (documented in AUDIO.md):
 *   BLE.begin() -> audio.begin() (common_init) -> create/stage BLEServer
 *   services -> audio.start() (single commit).
 *
 * NimBLE-only: on Bluedroid, incremental multi-app GATTS registration already
 * lets audio coexist through a separate GATTS app, so the Bluedroid server
 * path stays thin and does not use this coordinator.
